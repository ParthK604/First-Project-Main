    <h2>History of Coding</h2>
    <p>The initial history of coding and its pioneers is a fascinating journey through mathematics, logic, and early computing machinery. Here's a clear, concise breakdown of how coding (computer programming) 
        began and who laid its foundation:</p>
    <h3>They are as follows</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)  The First Programmer</b></li>
        <li><i>Alan Turing (1912–1954) – Father of Theoretical Computer</i></li>
        <li><u>John von Neumann (1903–1957) – Von Neumann Architecture</u></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Describing their History</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><h3 style="color: black;">  Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)</h3></dt>
        <dd>ugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), also known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
            She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.
            Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke.[2] 
            All her half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women.[3] 
            Lord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. 
            He died in Greece when she was eight.

       <dt> <h3 style="color: black;">2)  Alan Turing (1912–1954)</h3> </dt>
       <dd>Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. 
        The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.
        Turing was interested in artificial intelligence.
         He proposed the Turing test, to say when a machine could be called "intelligent". 
         A computer could be said to "think" if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.[2]
         During World War II, Turing worked with others to break German ciphers (secret messages). 
         He worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. Using cryptanalysis, he helped to break the codes of the Enigma machine. After that, he worked on other German codes.
        From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was "the first detailed design of a stored-program computer".[</dd>
